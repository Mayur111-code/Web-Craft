      title: "1. System Architecture Overview",
      content: `
WebCraft is built using a scalable, service-oriented MERN architecture. The application is divided into independent layers to ensure maintainability, performance, and scalability.

• Presentation Layer: React 18 + Tailwind CSS
• Application Layer: Node.js with Express
• Data Layer: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
• Authentication Layer: JWT-based token system

The frontend and backend are completely decoupled and communicate via RESTful APIs, allowing independent deployment and scaling.
      `,
    },
    {
      icon: <Layers className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "2. Frontend Architecture",
      content: `
The frontend is built with React 18 using a component-driven architecture.

Key practices:
• Reusable UI components
• Atomic design principles
• Framer Motion for animations
• Lazy loading with React Suspense
• Global state management using Context API

Folder structure:
• components/ – reusable UI components
• pages/ – route-level components
• hooks/ – custom React hooks
• services/ – API communication
• utils/ – helper functions

This approach ensures readability, scalability, and ease of collaboration.
      `,
    },
    {
      icon: <Database className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "3. Backend Architecture",
      content: `
The backend is built with Node.js and Express following MVC principles.

Core layers:
• Routes – API endpoints
• Controllers – business logic
• Services – reusable logic
• Models – MongoDB schemas
• Middleware – authentication, logging, validation

MongoDB is used for flexible schema design and high performance with indexing and aggregation pipelines.
      `,
    },
    {
      icon: <ShieldCheck className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "4. Authentication & Security",
      content: `
Security is implemented at multiple levels.

Implemented mechanisms:
• JWT authentication with access & refresh tokens
• Password hashing using bcrypt
• Role-based access control (Admin, Officer, User)
• CSRF protection
• Rate limiting for APIs
• Secure HTTP headers

All sensitive environment variables are stored securely using environment configuration.
      `,
    },
    {
      icon: <Code className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "5. Coding Standards & Best Practices",
      content: `
WebCraft follows strict development standards:

• Clean Code principles
• Meaningful variable & function names
• Single Responsibility Principle
• DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
• ESLint & Prettier enforced formatting
• Consistent folder and file naming

Git-flow strategy is used for feature development, bug fixes, and production releases.
      `,
    },
    {
      icon: <Bug className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "6. Testing & Quality Assurance",
      content: `
Quality assurance is integrated into the development lifecycle.

Testing includes:
• Unit testing for components and utilities
• API testing using Postman
• Manual UI testing
• Error handling & logging

Every release is tested against real-world scenarios to ensure reliability and stability.
      `,
    },
    {
      icon: <Zap className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "7. Performance Optimization",
      content: `
WebCraft is optimized for high performance.

Techniques used:
• Code splitting
• Lazy loading components
• Image optimization (WebP)
• API response caching
• Database indexing
• Optimized queries

The application consistently achieves 90+ Lighthouse performance scores.

    },
    {
      icon: <GitBranch className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "8. Version Control & Collaboration",
      content: `
Git and GitHub are used for version control.

Workflow:
• Feature branches
• Pull requests
• Code reviews
• Merge validations
• Commit message conventions

This ensures safe collaboration and production stability.
      `,
    },
    {
      icon: <Globe className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "9. Deployment & DevOps",
      content: `
Deployment is automated using CI/CD pipelines.

Deployment stack:
• Frontend: Vercel
• Backend: AWS / Render
• CI/CD: GitHub Actions
• HTTPS with SSL
• Auto-scaling enabled

Zero-downtime deployments are ensured using proper build pipelines.

    },
    {
      icon: <Book className="text-emerald-500" />,
      title: "10. Future Enhancements",
      content: `
Planned improvements include:
• Microservices architecture
• WebSocket-based real-time updates
• Advanced monitoring dashboards
• AI-powered analytics
• Offline-first support
• Mobile application integration

WebCraft is designed to evolve with future technological demands.
